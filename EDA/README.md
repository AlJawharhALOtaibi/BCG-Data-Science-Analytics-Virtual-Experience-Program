### Task Overview

#### Sub-Task 1: 
Conduct comprehensive exploratory data analysis to understand data types, statistics, parameters, and variable distributions. Allocate 1 hour for this task.

#### Sub-Task 2: 
Validate the hypothesis that price sensitivity is correlated with churn. Define price sensitivity and calculate it. Spend 30 minutes on this analysis.

#### Sub-Task 3: 
Summarize key findings and propose suggestions for additional data sources and useful open-source datasets in a half-page summary or slide. Allocate 10-15 minutes for this task.

### Final Deliverables

Submit your analysis in the form of a Jupyter notebook, code script, or PDF, along with a half-page summary document.


### Additional Findings:

- Approximately 9.7% of customers have churned.
- Outliers exist in the data and require treatment before modeling.
- Preliminary analysis suggests customers may not be sensitive to price changes.
