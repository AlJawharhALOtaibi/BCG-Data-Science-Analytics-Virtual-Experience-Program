## PowerCo Churn Prediction Project

## Overview

PowerCo, a major gas and electricity utility company, partnered with BCG to address customer churn, especially in the SME segment, after the power liberalization in the European energy market. This project focuses on understanding the impact of price changes on customer churn and developing predictive models to mitigate churn through targeted strategies.

### Project Tasks

1. **Business Understanding and Hypothesis Testing**
   - Hypothesis: Price changes significantly affect customer churn.
   - Data required: Historical customer data, pricing data, churn indicators.
   - Approach: Develop a predictive model to identify at-risk customers sensitive to price changes.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Verified the correlation between price sensitivity and churn.
   - Key Findings: Price sensitivity correlates with churn; suggested additional data sources for model enhancement.

3. **Feature Engineering and Modelling**
   - Engineered features from available data and improved feature predictive power.
   - Utilized a Random Forest Classifier to predict churn probabilities.
   - Estimated potential cost savings by preventing churn using the model.

4. **Findings and Recommendations**
   - Abstract Slide Summary: Highlighted model accuracy, potential savings, and actionable insights.
   - Recommendations: Deploy the churn prediction model, continue data augmentation efforts, and monitor model performance.
